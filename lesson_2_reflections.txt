Lesson 3 Git Reflections

Reflections Question:
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need it?

Initializing a repository creates the framework for git commits to go.
On a literal level, it creates a hidden folder .git in the working directory
and creates several files within this for states to be committed.

Initializing a repository does not perform a first commit. We have to do that.

Reflections Question:
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The working directory contains all items that exist in a repository.
The staging area lets you take items in your repository and commit changes to them.
It's important to have these things separate, because sometimes you want to
commit only one file, or multiple files together.  This allows for that flexibility.
Also, having a separate repository from working directory is needed for git functionality.
