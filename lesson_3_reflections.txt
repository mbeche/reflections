Final Lesson: GitHub

Reflections Question:
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  I can think of several reasons why I would like to use github repository.
    It lets me work on my code from any computer - I just need to log on!
      It also serves as a backup in case I lose my computer or files get corrupted.
    It allows me to share my work with other people.
    I can use GitHub to host web pages so I can test them out on different devices
      This could be useful for adaptive response, or sharing a working version with a client

Reflections Question:
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	If you pulled changes automatically you might be in the middle of your own
	code update and then get an update from the GitHub interupting or messing
	up the code you are working on.
	Also an update to the shared repository might alter the functionality
	of the code you are working with. Or you may not know how to use this
	new feature and need to learn how to use it.
	
Reflections Question:
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
When would you use one instead of the other?

	A clone would be used when you want to save a Git repository from GitHub
	or to copy a repository on your computer to another location.
	The drawback with clone, despite containing commit history and branches,
	is that clone does not allow for authorship attribution.
	Forking on GitHub does allow for authorship attribution, and then you
	can cloan the fork so that you make changes on your computer and then
	push changes back to GitHub.
	Cloning would likely push back changes to the original author's GitHub
	as suggested changes, which may not be your inteded goal.
	Branching creates a different state, whether on a clone or a fork.
	It is kind of a subset of forking and cloaning.
