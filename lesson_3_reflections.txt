Final Lesson: GitHub

Reflections Question:
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  I can think of several reasons why I would like to use github repository.
    It lets me work on my code from any computer - I just need to log on!
      It also serves as a backup in case I lose my computer or files get corrupted.
    It allows me to share my work with other people.
    I can use GitHub to host web pages so I can test them out on different devices
      This could be useful for adaptive response, or sharing a working version with a client
